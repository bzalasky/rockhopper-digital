<strong>Learning from the Poor Judgment of Others</strong>

In "[Design Paradigms: Case Histories of Error and Judgment in Engineering](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521466490/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0521466490&linkCode=as2&tag=rockhodigita-20)," Henry Petroski details several civil engineering failures throughout history. The text also includes candid analysis of the reasoning that led to each failure. 

Petroski begins his discussion of errors in conceptual design with the story of *[Paconius and the Pedestal of Apollo](http://www.kuhf.org/programaudio/engines/eng1101_64k.m3u)*.

Let's explore how this civil engineering lesson can be applied to the design and development of software. If you're not familiar with the story, listen to the radio program linked above.

<strong>The Folly of Competing Objectives</strong>

UX driving technical decisions.  

<strong>Stand on the Shoulders of Peers</strong>

<strong>In Summary</strong>

To spare future generations the dramatic irony of reading about your own spectacular failures:

- Recognize competing objectives and work to resolve them.
- Explore potential solutions to complicated problems with other engineers. 
- Question and attack your own ideas, but don't stop having them.
