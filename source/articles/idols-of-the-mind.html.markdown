<strong>Empiricism in Product Development</strong>

[Francis Bacon wrote about *idols of the mind*](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/francis-bacon/#Ido), with regard to scientific inquiry. This is a nod to his style of clear, empirical thinking, with regard to product development (software, or otherwise).

Here are four ways to build a product nobody wants.


1.  <strong>Rely on preconceived assumptions</strong>

    Questions are one of the best tools for avoiding unwarranted assumptions. Paul Graham suggests, "[The initial idea](http://paulgraham.com/ideas.html) is just a starting point--not a blueprint, but a question." A fresh perspective is invaluable when entering a domain that's ripe for disruption. However, failure to recognize your own innate biases can limit your ability to innovate. From your target market, to the problem your product solves, don't limit yourself with assumptions unless you've a compelling reason. There are times when assumptions are unavoidable, but that's ok as long as you recognize them. 


2.  <strong>Fail to acknowledge external perspectives</strong>

    Idiosyncratic belief and passion are often at the heart of brilliance. They are also barriers that can feed your own echo chamber. Don't fall victim to this. External perspectives lend insight into the alignment of your product in the marketplace, balancing raw, creative effort with instructive guidance. Graham (in the same essay on ideas) suspects the *together-alone-together sandwich* as being the most productive setup for conceiving and implementing great ideas. I tend to agree with him. Time spent reflecting alone on your discussions with others shouldn't be discounted.   


3.  <strong>Forget that talk is cheap</strong>

    Talk is cheap in all forms. This goes beyond just put up or shut up. Don't "let the power of mere words induce belief in non-existent things," as Edward O. Wilson paraphrases Bacon's *idols of the marketplace* in [Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/067976867X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=067976867X&linkCode=as2&tag=rockhodigita-20) (unashamed to drop an affiliate link here). Just as talking about your product won't get you to launch, someone telling you a market exists doesn't mean it actually does. Take steps to empirically validate any assumptions you've made about your product and its place in the world.


4.  <strong>Let dogmatic thinking cloud your vision</strong>
    
    Unquestioning acceptance is almost never a good thing for product development. An open mind allows you to see opportunities that would be missed if you closed off your thinking. Dogmatic thinking begets more of the same old thing. The product might not be terrible, but you're running the risk of developing the kind of uninspiring software that needs to be sold with [fancy steak dinners and extravagant bar tabs](http://vimeo.com/2723800). Shake up the enterprise and don't box yourself in! 
    

<strong>In Summary</strong>

Start with a question. See the world as it is. Make something better.
